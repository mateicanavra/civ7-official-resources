			<Text>The Yucatan Peninsula is full of sinkholes, areas where soluble limestone is worn down by erosion and creates deep vertical caves – centoes. When the sea rises to fill these caverns, they become “blue holes” – stunning circular blue features of extreme depth. The Great Blue Hole in Belize is one of these – at 410 feet deep, it is not the deepest, but it is the widest at nearly 1000 feet.</Text>

			<Text>Because of the poor circulation of water in such holes, they remain relatively devoid of oxygen and therefore of life, and for this reason remarkably clear. Their blue color comes from the lightness of the sand, the diffraction of light, and the clarity of the water. They can be deadly to divers, especially the Blue Hole in Egypt, because of their deceptive clarity and depth. </Text>

			<Text>Great gouts of water rush skyward with each wave, and with each spout comes a tremendous sound – the “whistle of the nobles,” the Mapu ‘a Vaea. The blowholes are the result of waves being forced through eroded portions of coastal rock on the coast of Tonga, and are associated with the Vaea noble family of that island. </Text>
