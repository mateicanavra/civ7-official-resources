			<Text>Some time in the late 12th century CE the Saudeleur Dynasty arose in the Pohnpei islands of what is now Micronesia. At its capital was a city of canals and artificial islands, built with large slabs of basalt and coral, and interwoven with tombs and residences. Many of these islands were specialized towards particular activities – the construction of canoes, for instance, or the housing of the families of distant chiefs (the better to control their homelands). </Text>

			<Text>The structures housed less than a thousand residents, of which chiefs and priests were a significant, but not majority, part. Indeed, differences in burial and residence (as well as local history) indicate that Saudeleur society was highly stratified, with a ruling chiefly class and elaborate mortuary practices surrounding them. The islands had to import food and water, labor made easier by its elaborate canal system. </Text>

			<Text>Nan Madol is striking in its megalithic architecture, and its legends of a dragon assisting in its construction. For this reason, it has often been the target of pseudoscientific speculation, from the lost continent of Mu to ancient aliens to Graham Hancock’s recent claims. The alternative to these theories is, of course, the idea that a lot of people worked very hard for a long time. </Text>
