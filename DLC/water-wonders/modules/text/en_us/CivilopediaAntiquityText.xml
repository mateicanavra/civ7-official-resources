			<Text>If the Nile was the heart of Egypt, it was the lighthouse at Alexandria that opened it to the world. After Alexander’s reign and the fragmentation of his empire, the rule of Egypt fell to Ptolemy, who sought to make Egypt a viable independent state, oriented outward, towards the Mediterranean. And so, in the 200s BCE, working from an initial proposal by the former conqueror, he ordered the construction of the lighthouse.</Text>

			<Text>The approach to the Nile Delta can be a treacherous thing. Low-lying lands and sunken shoals pose a threat to sailors, and a long and often hidden sandbank threatens approaching ships. This was something those living on the island of Pharos knew well, as they had made a living from scavenging the wrecks of ships that had failed in their approach. But the new city of Alexandria needed a proper approach, a proper gateway for Egypt.  </Text>

			<Text>The architect Sostratus designed the lighthouse: over three hundred feet of light stone, built upon a square base, with a mirror at its top, and a fire burning at night. Over all of this was a statue of Zeus, a symbol of rule, and of the Greek domination of Egypt. The wonder was ruined by successive earthquakes in the medieval period, and finally demolished to build a fortress on the site. </Text>
