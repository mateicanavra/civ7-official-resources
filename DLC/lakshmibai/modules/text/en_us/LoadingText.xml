			<Text>Lakshmibai, Rani of Jhansi, on the back of great Baadal, you come in a thunder of hooves - and you will not have your birthright denied. With raised saber, you call upon your people to defend what is theirs, and deny thieves and plunderers their prize. Stand, Rani, and show what it is to be a leader.</Text>
