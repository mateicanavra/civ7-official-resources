			<Text>From humble nomadic origins, the Ottoman Empire spanned six centuries to become one of the world’s most powerful empires. Even through its long decline, it was a heavy hitter on the global stage, and its final centuries, in our Modern Age, helped shape Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa as we know them today.</Text>

			<Text>The Ottoman Empire’s foundations lie in the Middle Ages. In the 11th century, Turkic tribes migrated west from Central Asia to establish the Seljuk dynasty. A major challenger of the Byzantine Empire, they cracked open Anatolia with their victory at Manzikert (1071), initiating a Turkic presence in the region. After the Seljuks fell to the Mongols in 1243, Turkic tribes in Anatolia persisted, particularly those under Osman I (1259-1326), who seized Byzantine and former Seljuk territories to found a ruling dynasty named after him – the Ottomans.</Text>

			<Text>Expansion into Europe began in 1345, and in 1453, Mehmed the Conqueror captured Constantinople, ending Byzantium and heralding the Ottoman Golden Age. During the 16th century, under Selim I and Süleyman the Magnificent, the empire reached its greatest geographical extent of nearly 900,000 square miles. A combination of direct and vassal rule pushed the Ottoman presence deep into Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, and it became a major naval power in the Mediterranean. Istanbul (formerly Constantinople, and formally Kostantiniyye) operated as a major merchant hub, with trade focused around the Grand Bazaar. The arts flourished through poetry, painting, and architecture, and manifested many of the great mosques still extant in Istanbul.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_OTTOMANS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>The following century saw the Ottomans maintain power, but expansion slowed. Sultans became less involved in day-to-day politics, and nepotism and corruption took root across the government. These internal problems soon manifested externally. In 1699, the empire lost significant European territory in Hungary, and wars with Russia, Austria, and Poland further chipped away at Ottoman power. While many Ottomans remained confident in the aging systems that had once launched them to the peak of power, others pushed for change to rejuvenate the empire and reclaim its place on the world stage. The empire had long bridged the crossroads of Asia, Africa, and Europe, but as major competitors rose increasingly in the West, some rulers endeavored to modernize in their image. The Tulip Period (1718-1730), a peaceful period under Sultan Ahmed III, saw the state begin to embrace Western influence, particularly in artistic and architectural styles such as Ottoman Baroque.</Text>

			<Text>Subsequent reforms attempted to break out of the conservative model that, centuries earlier, had been progressive, but was now causing stagnation in an era of rapid modernization. This conflict between religious traditionalists who sought to preserve existing structures and secular reformists who sought to remake the Ottomans in the image of the West was a major feature of the late Ottoman period. A notable powder keg was a series of military reforms at the turn of the 19th century – these attempted to update the army with European arms, tactics, and organization in order to address weaknesses revealed in recent wars with Russia. But the changes sparked a revolt among the five-centuries-old Janissary Corps, who were violently terminated as a result. The empire shrank further as Balkan provinces, following Greece’s lead, declared independence, and African territories were seized by European powers.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_OTTOMANS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>The last major push to save the failing empire occurred during the Tanẓîmât (1839-1879). This period saw sweeping constitutional reforms that targeted the economy, the military, education, the legal system, and more, primarily focused on replacing older religious systems with Western-styled secular ones through processes of centralization, standardization, and equality. However, the reforms failed to satisfy either side – the traditionalists fought the changes fiercely, and the secular side felt the reforms did not go far enough.</Text>

			<Text>By the early 20th century, the Ottoman Empire was on its last legs. Floundering under economic, social, and diplomatic crises, its government was overhauled by the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, restoring a previously short-lived constitution. Paranoia about future independence movements among the empire’s diverse population led to the perpetration of several genocides, including that of Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Kurds. The Ottomans allied with Germany during WWI and saw initial success until the Arab Revolt; after the war, Ottoman territory was heavily partitioned by the Allies. In 1923, Turkish nationalist forces led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk brought an end to the empire, and the Republic of Türkiye was founded.</Text>

			<Text>Centered around a mosque, the külliye was a complex of buildings dedicated to the spiritual, physical, and mental wellbeing of the community. They could be found peppered throughout Ottoman cities, locating hospitals, schools, and kitchens around the central place of worship.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_QUARTER_KULLIYE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>In Istanbul, the many külliye were built to sculpt the landscape, marking it as owned by the Sultan. The most stunning example is the Süleymaniye Külliye, named for its sponsor Süleyman the Magnificent. Together with the central mosque, it had seven schools, a hostel, hospitals, and shops, similar to the diversity of buildings and services we would find on a modern university campus. Today, külliye can still be found throughout Anatolia. Many have been renovated into museums; others are still part of their communities, the core of a neighborhood or suburb.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_BUILDING_HAMMAM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>In the Ottoman Empire, the rich and poor could enjoy the services of the local hammam, a public bath that was often one component of a külliye. Visitors would undress to a modest minimum and then proceed through a sequence of bathing rooms, from cold to hot. Ottoman baths were important to both the religious and social life of the neighborhoods, providing opportunity for ritual bathing and gendered space to speak freely.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_BUILDING_HAMMAM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>In practice and design, the hammam evolved from a combination of the old Greek and Roman baths of the Byzantine period along with the Islamic baths common during the Umayyad Caliphate. The Ottomans continued these practices and imbued them with a style all their own as can be seen in the luxurious, domed hot rooms of the traditional hammams still operating in Istanbul.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_BUILDING_CAMII_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Throughout the Ottoman Empire, worshippers of Islam would visit a local mosque, or “cami,” to pray and engage with the community. These places of worship often formed the core of a larger complex of buildings known as a külliye. Mosques were central to the communal fabric of Ottoman society and were often the most ornate examples of Ottoman architecture.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_BUILDING_CAMII_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Mosques in the Ottoman Empire adopted an architecture exemplified by the single large dome over the square prayer hall. The technique used to transition from a circular dome to a square chamber was the Turkish triangle, a kind of pendentive originally seen in the Hagia Sophia and used extensively in later Byzantine constructions. Ottoman mosques from the 18th century onward more closely imitated European architecture, specifically French Rococo and Baroque styles. Mosques from this period tend to have more ornate ornamentation with a proliferation of rounded features.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_WONDER_SULTANAHMET_CAMII_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Known as the "Blue Mosque" in English, the Sultanahmet Camii is one of the most iconic examples of Ottoman architecture. It occupies a meaningful space in Istanbul, across from the Hagia Sophia and bordering the Hippodrome of the Byzantine period. Its design reflects both Byzantine and Islamic architecture, exemplifying the classical Ottoman architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries.</Text>

			<Text>The interior of the mosque is ornately decorated with tiles and painted motifs. Flowers, fruit, and other designs from the period line the walls in various colors, predominantly blue. Outside, multiple courtyards lead to the entrances, and six slender minarets line the grounds. Surrounding the mosque are other buildings serving communal needs – a hospital, a bathhouse, and a school originally completed the complex. A lively bazaar lines the street on the southeast, hosting hundreds of shops catering to locals and tourists alike.</Text>

			<Text>The Ottomans were masters of early siege cannonry in the 15th century, deploying the great weapons in many battles with the Byzantines. Eventually, they conquered Constantinople itself with the help of the giant bombards, ending the Byzantine period and ushering in their own empire.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_MO_OTTOMANS_SAHI_TOPU_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Ten years after Constantinople's fall, another gigantic cannon was cast, modeled after one of the super-sized weapons used to take the great city. The Şahi Topu, or Dardanelles Gun as it came to be known, weighed 17 tonnes and could fire stone projectiles weighing up to 750 lbs. Still active nearly 350 years after its creation, it was instrumental in defending Constantinople from the British during the Dardanelles operation of 1807. Its giant cannonballs were fired on the British ships, causing immense damage and quickly putting an end to their mission. Today, the Dardanelles Gun can be seen in Fort Nelson, England, having been gifted to Queen Victoria by Sultan Abdülaziz after it was decommissioned.</Text>

			<Text>Military reforms in the 19th century remade the Ottoman army into a more modern force trained by military commanders from across Europe and organized under the bureaucracy. The Harbiye Nezâreti was the "Ministry of War," founded to impose order on the ranks after the Janissaries were decommissioned. The ministry managed such necessities as combat supplies, mobilization, and rank.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_MO_OTTOMANS_HARBIYE_NEZARETI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Part of these military reforms included the construction of military academies, or “harbiyeler,” likened after similar institutions in Europe. These harbiyeler were instrumental in educating and training the Ottoman military force to be able to compete with its peers and rivals in this period. The Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi was a competitive military school that trained the most elite of the Ottoman officers in the early 20th century. Not only were the harbiyeler key to the efficacy of the Ottoman forces, but their students were vocal advocates for political change, leading to several demonstrations and attempted coups in both the late Ottoman Empire and early Republic of Türkiye.</Text>

			<Text>The Lâle Devri, or "Tulip Period," was a time of cultural fecundity and Western influence in the early 18th century of the Ottoman Empire. This period of peace saw the Empire pursue diplomatic and commercial interests across Europe, but it is most remembered as a time of fascination with the tulip. Spurred on by the hedonistic tendencies of Sultan Ahmed III and his Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha, Ottoman elites became enamored by the flower, and it adorned streets, buildings, and private gardens. Architecture adjusted to incorporate new floral motifs with traditional mother-of-pearl inlay (sedef kakma); patronage of culture led to new forms of poetry and art.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_MO_OTTOMANS_LALE_DEVRI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Not everyone was so pleased, however. The expenditures related to extravagant festivals and the focus on the elites ignited unrest among the people. Instigated by rivals of the Grand Vizier, a group of insurgents marched through the capital while the Sultan and his officers were on holiday. Fearing for his life, the Sultan agreed to the demands of the crowd: kill the Grand Vizier and hand his body over to the people. So ended the Tulip Period, the peace and beauty of the time now just a memory.</Text>

			<Text>During the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire recognized its decline compared to European nations and attempted to implement a variety of reforms aimed at modernization. The Tanẓîmât was a period from 1839-1876 that saw a host of changes to the Ottoman administration, military, and infrastructure, aiming to solidify the strength of the Empire by adapting Western models. Some changes like efforts to increase religious freedom and equality faced serious resistance from conservative groups while falling too short to satisfy more progressive voices. Despite these setbacks, the Tanẓîmât succeeded in implementing a number of reforms such as curtailing the slave trade, strengthening education, and reforming the judiciary, that had lasting effects on the lands that would later become independent states.</Text>

			<Text>In the 14th century, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, either Murad I or his father Orhan, chose to create a personal army of men loyal only to him. Initially, these Janissaries, as they were called, were recruited from non-Muslim slaves, primarily from the Balkans. The Ottomans would choose young children from these groups, place them with Turkish families to convert to Islam and learn Turkish, and then enroll them in the Janissary Corps once deemed mature and fit.  Jannissaries were one of the first infantry armies to equip firearms, and their excellent training and loyalty made them a fearsome force throughout the 14th through 17th centuries. They were instrumental in all of the major Ottoman campaigns, including the capture of Constantinople in 1493 CE. As the primary infantry force within the Ottoman military, they played a key role in protecting the core of the force, especially the Sultan, while the elite Turkish cavalry charged and feinted from the flanks.</Text>

Their high wages and inordinate influence made them unpopular with the average citizen. When the Janissaries disagreed with the Sultan, they could easily seize power in a province and wield it unfairly against the inhabitants as happened in Serbia during the early 19th century. Fearing that the Sultan would dissolve their post, Janissaries rebelled and launched raids against the local Serbs. After receiving a pardon from the Sultan, they returned to  murder the governor, behead prominent Serbs, and tyrannize the locals.

Up to this point, their rebellions had always been successful, but this time, the Sultan was prepared. He torched their barracks, burning alive around 4,000 men.
